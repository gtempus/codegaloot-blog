Code Galoot is a technical blog that seeks to document my experiences gained through an insatiable appetite for all things software engineering; The good, the bad and the ugly. I entered into the software engineering profession immediately after graduating from Colorado State University in 2005. I have worked in three different shops since that time. The first two were very corporate environments. Having my fill of that scene I sought out a much smaller company to continue my journey.
